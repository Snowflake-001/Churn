###Telecom Churn
Churn refers to the rate at which customers cancel their service or switch to a competitor. This Telecom churn dataset consists of cleaned customer activity data, along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription.
I analyzed the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with recommendations to ensure customer retention.
#Data
Telecom companies collect a vast amount of data on their customers, including demographic information, usage patterns, and billing history. This data can be used to identify the factors that contribute to customer churn.
The dataset also includes churn data, which indicates whether or not a customer has churned.
In this project, I analyzed the relationship between customer attributes and churn with the use of variety of statistical techniques to identify the customer attributes that have the greatest impact on churn.

#Business understanding of a Telecom Industry Customer Churn
High churn rates can lead to lost revenue and profits. It is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry. The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer churn is huge, especially in the telecom field, that’s why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer churn. 
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunication industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate, and it cost 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that’s why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn.
The main goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the cause of customer churn which assist telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn, and what to do to retain the most valuable customer.
We will find how we can maximize the profit by retaining customers, and, how we can reduce the churn by identifying the issues.

#Results:
The analysis showed that there are a number of customer attributes that are significantly associated with churn. These attributes include:
• Gender: Male customers are more likely to churn than female customers.
• Location: Customers in rural areas are more likely to churn than customers in urban areas.
• Tenure with the company: Customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time are more likely to churn than customers who have been with the company for a longer period of time.
• Monthly usage: Customers who use their service more frequently are less likely to churn than customers who use their service less frequently.
• Billing history: Customers who have a history of late payments or service interruptions are more likely to churn than customers who do not have a history of these issues.
Conclusion:The results provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry. These insights can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns and customer retention strategies.
#Implications:
The findings have several implications for telecom companies:• Telecom companies should develop targeted marketing campaigns for male customers, as they are also more likely to churn.• Telecom companies should invest in improving their service in rural areas, as customers in these areas are more likely to churn.
• Telecom companies should offer incentives to customers who have been with the company for a shorter period of time, as these customers are more likely to churn.
• Telecom companies should monitor customer usage patterns and billing history, as these factors can be indicative of potential churn.
#Future Work:
There are several areas for future research on customer churn in the telecom industry. One area of future research could be to explore the relationship between customer churn and other factors, such as customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Another area of future research could be to develop a model that can predict customer churn based on their attributes.
